# learning-python

As the name suggests, I will be adding any small snippets of code or incomplete projects that I have done for fun, but haven't turned into full-fledged projects. 
It's a showcase of what I've learned, and a way for me to go back and look at my progress in a tangible way.

## BB84 Protocol
*21/5/2024*: I had created a simulation of an incomplete BB84 protocol for my telecommunications networks course project. I say incomplete 
because I had struggled to simulate the latter half, 'Bob,' even though I did do 'Alice.' As it stands, I'm not sure when I'll complete it,
as it does require a level of mathematics that I'm unfamiliar with but would hope to learn someday. 

*Additional notes*:
- I wasn't inspired by specific code floating around the web, as it was just an attempt to turn the theoretical explanation into code. Not much complex mathematics involved.
- The table I referenced in my report was something similar to this one: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/BB84-quantum-protocol-scheme_fig2_334070231, and from there, I just played around with the random module.
